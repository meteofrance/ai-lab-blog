# Py4cast: A Framework to Train & Compare AI Weather Forecasting Models

## Introduction

In this paper, we present Py4cast, a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the training and comparison of AI-based weather forecasting models. Py4cast aims to streamline the experimentation process, allowing researchers to efficiently test various neural network architectures and methodologies. We demonstrate the utility of Py4cast through a series of experiments using the TITAN dataset, showcasing its capability to produce accurate weather forecasts and its flexibility in accommodating different model types.

## Discussion

The initial experiments underscore the potential of AI in weather forecasting, highlighting the importance of exploring diverse neural network architectures. Py4cast's flexibility allows for rapid experimentation and iteration, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field.

## Future Work

Future developments will focus on expanding the TITAN dataset, testing additional architectures such as GraphCast and Pangu, and optimizing training strategies to enhance resource efficiency. We also plan to incorporate high-resolution wave models and conduct further studies on the impact of time step duration on forecast quality.

## Conclusion

Py4cast represents a significant step forward in the application of AI to weather forecasting. By providing a versatile and efficient framework, it enables researchers to push the boundaries of what is possible in this critical field.
